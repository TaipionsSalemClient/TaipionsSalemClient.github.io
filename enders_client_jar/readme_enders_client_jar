This file is an updated enders client based on his latest version, with the addition of cravings! :-)

Simply replace your salem.jar with this one in your \Salem\ folder under:
C:\Users\[yourUserName]\Salem\bin\

Then make it read-only to prevent enders updater from overwriting it.
(windows: right-click -> properties -> read only -> ok)
